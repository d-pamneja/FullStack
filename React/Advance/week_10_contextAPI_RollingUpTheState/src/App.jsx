// a better way would be state management. This is not optimal as this creates a lot of re-renders

// Prop drilling
// Prop drilling occurs when you need to pass data from a higher-level component down to a lower-level component that is several layers deep in the component tree. This often leads to the following issues:
// Complexity: You may have to pass props through many intermediate components that donâ€™t use the props themselves, just to get them to the component that needs them.
// Maintenance: It can make the code harder to maintain, as changes in the props structure require updates in multiple components.
